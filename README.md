# MikroDash
### The Ultimate MikroTik RouterOS Dashboard.

> Real-time MikroTik RouterOS v7 dashboard — streaming binary API, Socket.IO, Docker-ready.

MikroDash connects directly to the RouterOS API over a persistent binary TCP connection, streaming live data to the browser via Socket.IO. No page refreshes. No agents. Just plug in your router credentials and go.

## Features

### Dashboard
- **Live traffic chart** — per-interface RX/TX Mbps with configurable history window (1m–30m)
- **System card** — CPU, RAM, Storage gauges with colour-coded thresholds (amber >75%, red >90%), board info, temperature, uptime chip
- **RouterOS update indicator** — shows installed vs available version side by side
- **Network card** — animated SVG topology diagram with live wired/wireless client counts, WAN IP, LAN subnets, and latency chart (ping to 1.1.1.1)
- **Connections card** — total connection count sparkline, protocol breakdown bars (TCP/UDP/ICMP), top sources with hostname resolution, top destinations with geo-IP country flags
- **Top Talkers** — top 5 devices by active traffic with RX/TX rates
- **WireGuard card** — active peer list with status and last handshake

### Pages
| Page | Description |
|---|---|
| Wireless | Clients grouped by interface with signal quality, band badge (2.4/5/6 GHz), IP, TX/RX rates, and sortable columns |
| Interfaces | All interfaces as compact tiles with status, IP, live rates, and cumulative RX/TX totals |
| DHCP | Active DHCP leases with hostname, IP, MAC, and expiry |
| VPN | All WireGuard peers (active + idle) as tiles sorted active-first, with allowed IPs, endpoint, handshake, and traffic counters |
| Connections | World map with animated arcs to destination countries, per-country protocol breakdown, sparklines, top ports panel, and click-to-filter |
| Firewall | Top hits, Filter, NAT, and Mangle rule tables with packet counts |
| Logs | Live router log stream with severity filter and text search |

### Notifications
- Bell icon in topbar opens an alert history panel showing the last 50 alerts with timestamps
- Browser push notifications (when permitted) for:
  - Interface down / back up
  - WireGuard peer disconnected / reconnected
  - CPU exceeds 90% (1-minute cooldown)
  - 100% ping loss to 1.1.1.1

## ⚠️ Security Notice

MikroDash is designed to run **on your local network only**. It has no built-in HTTPS or role-based access control.

**Do not expose MikroDash directly to the internet.** Doing so would allow anyone to:
- View live data from your router (traffic, clients, connections, firewall rules, logs)
- Read your WAN IP, LAN topology, and connected device information
- Monitor your network activity in real time

If you need remote access, place MikroDash **behind an authenticating reverse proxy** (such as Nginx with Basic Auth, Authelia, or Cloudflare Access) or access it exclusively over a VPN.

**Recommended local hardening:**
- Set `BASIC_AUTH_USER` and `BASIC_AUTH_PASS` to require HTTP Basic Auth for the dashboard and Socket.IO endpoint
- Run on a non-default port and bind to your LAN interface only
- Set `chmod 600 .env` to protect your router credentials
- Ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` and never committed to version control
- Use a dedicated read-only API user on the router (see RouterOS Setup below)

## Quick Start

### Option 1 — Docker Hub / GHCR (recommended)

Pull and run the pre-built image directly — no need to clone the repo:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/secops-7/mikrodash:latest
```

Create your `.env` file:

```bash
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash/main/.env.example
# Edit .env — set ROUTER_HOST, ROUTER_USER, ROUTER_PASS, DEFAULT_IF
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d   --name mikrodash   --restart unless-stopped   --env-file .env   -p 3081:3081   ghcr.io/secops-7/mikrodash:latest
```

Or with Docker Compose — create a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
services:
  mikrodash:
    image: ghcr.io/secops-7/mikrodash:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file: .env
    ports:
      - "3081:3081"
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Option 2 — Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SecOps-7/MikroDash.git
cd MikroDash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set ROUTER_HOST, ROUTER_USER, ROUTER_PASS, DEFAULT_IF
docker compose up -d
```

- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3081`
- Health check: `http://localhost:3081/healthz`

## RouterOS Setup

Create a read-only API user (recommended):

```
/ip service set api port=8728 disabled=no
/user group add name=mikrodash policy=read,api,!local,!telnet,!ssh,!ftp,!reboot,!write,!policy,!test,!winbox,!web,!sniff,!sensitive,!romon,!rest-api
/user add name=mikrodash group=mikrodash password=your-secure-password
```

To use API-SSL (TLS) instead, enable the ssl service and set `ROUTER_TLS=true` in your `.env`:

```
/ip service set api-ssl disabled=no port=8729
```

## Architecture

### Streamed (router pushes on change — zero poll overhead)
| Data | RouterOS endpoint |
|---|---|
| WAN Traffic RX/TX | `/interface/monitor-traffic` |
| Router Logs | `/log/listen` |
| DHCP Lease changes | `/ip/dhcp-server/lease/listen` |

### Polled (concurrent via tagged API multiplexing)
| Collector | Interval | Data |
|---|---|---|
| System | 3s | CPU, RAM, storage, temp, ROS version |
| Connections | 3s | Firewall connection table, geo-IP |
| Top Talkers | 3s | Kid Control traffic stats |
| Wireless | 5s | Wireless client list |
| Interface Status | 5s | Interface state, IPs, rx/tx bytes |
| VPN | 10s | WireGuard peers, rx/tx rates |
| Firewall | 10s | Rule hit counts |
| Ping | 10s | RTT + packet loss to PING_TARGET |
| DHCP Networks | 15s | LAN subnets, WAN IP |
| DHCP Leases | 15s | Active lease table |
| ARP | 30s | MAC to IP mappings |

All collectors run **concurrently** on a single TCP connection — no serial queuing.
